You don't have to have any previous knowledge of coding to attend! You can go in teams of 1-4. The hackathon is a three day hackathon, so it is recommended that you bring sleeping gear, in addition to any computers and electronics you would like to bring.

                Ludum Dare is a bi-annualy 72-hour game creation challenge. Participants will need to make a game (every competition has a theme!) using their own custom designed assets in the 3-day time limit. Games that are submitted will be scored based on different topics, such as creativity, graphics, audio, and overall game design. Participants can do the game with as many people as they want.
